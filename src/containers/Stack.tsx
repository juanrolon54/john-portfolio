        article: 'A half-baked """functional""" UI library created by Mark Zuckerberg, used by millions of developers all over the world because of it\'s cool name and logo. React is simple, it\'s just javascript (oh no). That means it gives you hundreds of ways of solving the same problem, functional and class components, hooks, forward refs, higherOrderComponents, mixins, renderprops and suspense. It\'s credited as the first declarative UI library, if that means anything. You can write pure functions, until you actually want to get a job, and you literally end up with ()=>void everywhere. The beauty of this approach is that it makes the things that javascript does great (not so many) useless and simple things harder (no joke). For instance, the "useEffect" hook was originally called "useFootGun" because to this day, it\'s default behaviour is an infinite loop. To wrap things up, you write things in JSX, an Xml like syntax that introduces callback hell, it\'s own synthetic event handling (whyyyy), and the benefit of completely erradicating markup debugging, since it\'s now impossible. 9/10 my favourit I luv it<3.',
